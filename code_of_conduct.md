+ Sexual images in public spaces 
+ Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following. 
+ Harassing photography or recording. 
+ Sustained disruption of talks or other events 
+ Inappropriate physical contact 
+ Unwelcome sexual attention 
+ Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior


### Enforcement
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the forum.
Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!
